It has been rightly said by Marcus Aurelius that ‚Äúnothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under the observation in life‚Äù.
From the earliest years of my life, I have been always intrigued by everything that would happen around and held a penchant for making things work and solving problems.
Hello, I am Diana Satapathy, an inquisitive soul and a process-oriented individual with a keen interest in the field of data analytics and wish to make a career in the same.
Graduated from Koustuv Institute of Self Domain in 2020 with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. A competent SQL coder with hands-on experience in Tableau, Microsoft Excel and now trying my hands with R. Always driven by curiosity and seeks to strike a balance between analytics, problem solving, business, and creativity. This attitude has helped in forging up one of my core principles i.e., PPDAC (Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, and Conclusion) approach. Proficient in interpreting and analyzing data to drive growth.
I as an individual have been truly benefitted from observing happenings around me and analyzing them from a fresh perspective that polished my analytical skills. Skilled in collecting, organizing, interpreting, and disseminating various types of statistical figures, I always enjoy working with data.
